* The **#student-lounge** is where you can interact with students from all six sections.

Our slack workspace is not just for me. It's for you and the other senior project sections, too. **Let's make Slack one of our collective workspaces! Miro will be the other.** \

<summary>6 Sign Up for the FREE Educational Version of Miro and Watch less than 10 min of tutorials</summary>

* We will be using Miro, a digital, collaborative whiteboarding tool. You do not need a Miro account to edit the board we'll be using, but I highly recommend that you sign up for a [FREE educational license](https://miro.com/education-whiteboard/2/)
* It's pretty intuitive to use. However, here is are some Miro tutorials if you are unfamiliar with the application.&#x20;

<!---->

* [How to create content in Miro](https://youtu.be/aHkUl-yUExE) (3 minute Youtube video)
* [Miro 101: Collaborating on a Board](https://youtu.be/Zc2c6HquANE) (< 3 minutes Youtube video)
* [How to Navigate Around A Miro Board](https://youtu.be/0olcwCD9-GM) (< 3 minutes Youtube video)

<!---->

* Hover over the toolbar to the left in Miro's interface to quickly get a sense of what each tool does.&#x20;
* The Comment tool looks like a quote. It's the 8th icon from the top of the left toolbar.
* The Zoom tool is in the bottom right hand corner of the interface. Hover over the percentage and you'll be able to see + and - signs. There are also key commands to zoom in and out (control + and - on the mac).&#x20;

<summary>9 (OPTIONAL) Brainstorm Project Ideas</summary>

* A few of you may already know what you want to do for your senior project. IF you are committed to your project, move on to step 10 of the pre-work: [project plan](project\_plan/). However, before you commit, make sure you read [**Welcome to Senior Project In Digital Media!**](https://deangela.gitbook.io/idm-senior-project-sp-2021-duff/syllabus#welcome-to-senior-project-in-digital-media) **AND** [**Your Commitment To Senior Project**](https://deangela.gitbook.io/idm-senior-project-sp-2021-duff/syllabus#your-commitment-to-senior-project) in the [syllabus](syllabus.md).
*   IF you need help coming up with ideas for your senior project, do one or more of the following brainstorming exercises BEFORE you complete the project plan. i.e. Take photos and/or screenshots OR write a [response](assignments/responses.md) depending on which is applicable), and upload your brainstorming exercises to a folder labeled "Pre-work" in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](end\_of\_semester\_deliverables/).

    * [Free Writing, Word Lists & Mind Maps](brainstorming/free-writing-word-lists-and-mind-maps.md)
    * [SCAMPER Technique](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCT\_02.htm)
