## Join Our Slack Workspace and Channel

Join our shared slack workspace with the other sections of IDM Senior Project with your nyu.edu email address. I also sent you an email invite.&#x20;

* The **#studentlounge** is where you can interact with students from all four sections.

Our slack workspace is not just for me. It's for you and the other senior project sections, too. Let's make it our workspace. Free feel to share what has been helping you stay happy, healthy, or productive during this unprecedented time in our class slack channel (#duff). Also share resources and references with each other. Also, interact with the students in the other sections in the #studentlounge channel. You can also direct message any student or faculty member from the four sections on slack. All classes are using the same slack workspace.

* IF you need help coming up with ideas for your senior project, do one or more of the following brainstorming exercises before you complete the project plan. i.e. Take photos and/or screenshots OR write a [response](assignments/responses.md) depending on which is applicable), and upload your brainstorming exercises to a folder labeled "Pre-work" in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](end\_of\_semester\_deliverables/).

## Populate Project Plan (Miro)&#x20;

Prepare your [project plan](project\_plan/) to present to your classmates on the 1st day of class. Everybody should be ready to present on the first day of class. You will have an opportunity to iterate it. So do the best you can for this first iteration.
