## Join Our Slack Workspace and Channel

Join our shared slack workspace with the other sections of IDM Senior Project with your nyu.edu email address. I also sent you an email invite.&#x20;

* **Join our class section channel (#duff)**.&#x20;
* The **#studentlounge** is where you can interact with students from all four sections.
* The **#announcements** channel is where you will find announcements that apply to all four sections.

Our slack workspace is not just for me. It's for you and the other senior project sections, too. Let's make it our workspace. Free feel to share what has been helping you stay happy, healthy, or productive during this unprecedented time in our class slack channel (#duff). Also share resources and references with each other. Also, interact with the students in the other sections in the #studentlounge channel. You can also direct message any student or faculty member from the four sections on slack. All classes are using the same slack workspace.

## Read The Syllabus Thoroughly

## (OPTIONAL) Brainstorm Project Ideas

* A few of you may already know what you want to do for your senior project. IF you are committed to your project, move on to the [pecha kucha presentation](assignments/pecha\_kucha.md). However, before you commit, make sure you read [**Welcome to Senior Project In Digital Media!**](https://deangela.gitbook.io/idm-senior-project-sp-2021-duff/syllabus#welcome-to-senior-project-in-digital-media) **AND** [**Your Commitment To Senior Project**](https://deangela.gitbook.io/idm-senior-project-sp-2021-duff/syllabus#your-commitment-to-senior-project) in the [syllabus](syllabus.md).
* IF you need help coming up with ideas for your senior project, do one or more of the following brainstorming exercises before you complete the pecha kucha presentation for the first day of class and document your brainstorming. i.e. Take photos and/or screenshots OR write a [response](assignments/responses.md) depending on which is applicable), post to your [process website](website.md), and upload your brainstorming exercises to a folder labeled "Pre-work" in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](end\_of\_semester\_deliverables/).
  * [Free Writing, Word Lists & Mind Maps](brainstorming/free-writing-word-lists-and-mind-maps.md)
  * [SCAMPER Technique](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCT\_02.htm)
  * [Card Sorting Technique](brainstorming/card\_sorting.md)
