<summary>6 Sign Up for the FREE Educational Version of Miro and Watch less than 10 min of tutorials</summary>

* It's pretty intuitive to use. However, here is are some Miro tutorials if you are unfamiliar with the application.&#x20;

<!---->

<!---->

* Hover over the toolbar to the left in Miro's interface to quickly get a sense of what each tool does.&#x20;
