# Project Plan

> Vision is the bottleneck of talent. Most talent is wasted because people do not clearly know what they want. It’s not a lack of effort but a lack of direction. There are many capable people in the world, but relatively few that focus on what matters. \~James Clear

This project plan will be constantly iterated over the course of the semester. It may grow and/or shrink over the course of the semester. Don't worry about "getting it right." The creative process is messy.

Please remember that you and a classmate can work as a team. Only one plan should be submitted per team.

* Please name your file as lastname\_senior\_sp21\_projectplandraft#\_date.pdf (i.e. duff\_senior\_sp21\_projectplan1\_2021jan15.pdf). If a team, please put both of your last names (i.e. duff\_and\_dubois) in the filename.
* Please note that any significant changes to your project will require the submission of a revised project plan.
* Upload drafts to a folder labeled _project plan_ in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](../end\_of\_semester\_deliverables/).

I highly recommend <a href="http://personalkanban.com">Personal Kanban</a>. Another system that is popular with students is the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn">Bullet Journal</a>. However, neither is required if you have another system with prioritization as a focus. If you do have another system, please share it with the instructor.</li><li>All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, code, collect, etc.), and can be completed in a day.</li><li>Also, be specific with your tasks. (For example, "take 20 photographs" is more explicit than "take photographs". "Take 5 photos of tigers, 5 photos of bears, 5 photos of lizards, and 5 photos of cats" is more explicit than "take 20 photographs".)</li><li><p>For creating and tracking your milestones and actionable tasks, you don't need a fancy system or tool. Google Docs works just fine. The main thing is whatever you use needs to be editable. However, other tools, besides google docs, that you can use to track your milestones progress are:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://asana.com">Asana</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://monday.com">Monday</a> is an Asana alternative.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://milanote.com">Milanote</a></li><li><a href="https://www.notion.so">Notion</a></li><li><p><a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a></p><ul><li><a href="http://kanbanery.com">Kanbanery.com</a> is a Trello aternative.</li></ul></li><li>Moleskine's <a href="https://moleskinestudio.com/actions/">Actions</a> </li></ul></li></ul> |
