# Project Versions

The specific parameters and expectations of each version will be individually determined in consultation with the professor except for the teaser.

* **Teaser** is the ideas and story behind your project. Your vision.
* **Preview** is when your project is ready for user testing.
* **Launch** is when all the bugs in your project have been fixed and quality is assured. It is ready to go public. It is ready to "shipped" and consumed by the public.

## Feedback Through User Testing

You should be conducting research and user testing throughout the ENTIRE semester. Do not wait until the last minute to begin user testing; User testing gives you invaluable feedback about your project.
