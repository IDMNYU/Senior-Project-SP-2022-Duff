## What it Means to Have a Creative Practice

> "Greatness is consistency.\
> &#x20; Meditating once is common. Meditating daily is rare.\
> &#x20; Exercising today is simple. Training every week is simply remarkable.\
> &#x20; Writing one essay rarely matters. Write every day and you're practically a hero.\
> &#x20; Unheroic days can make for heroic decades." \
> \~James Clear

I suggest listening to Derek Sivers, Debbie Millman, and David Heinemeier Hansson

* In Season 1, Alex Blumberg told the story of launching this business, Gimlet Media, a podcast network.
* In Season 2, Lisa Chow joined Alex to follow an entirely new company: a company called Dating Ring, founded by two women in their 20s, outsiders in the male-dominated world of Silicon Valley.
* In Season 3, rather than following one company over many episodes, they are telling stories about many companies that all have something in common: their companies are stuck, and they know they need to make a big change.
