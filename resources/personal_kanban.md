# Time Management

> "It is wonderful how much work can be got through in a day, if we go by the rule—map out our time, divide it off, and take up one thing regularly after another. To drift through our work, or to rush through it in a helter-skelter fashion, ends in comparatively little being done. "One thing at a time" will always perform a better day's work than doing two or three things at a time. By following this rule, one person will do more in a day than another does in a week."\

## If you don't already have them, you should create systems to manage your energy, time, and projects.

The secret is discipline, focus, and prioritizing (which requires not doing something else). No system is a magic cure. A system only works if you use it daily.

## Energy Management (AKA Sleep, Eat, Move, Play)

Energy Management is easy in theory. Difficult in practice.

* Sleep Well.
* Eat Well.
* Move (Exercise).
* Play or Relax.

## Time Management (AKA Keep A Calendar(s))

It is imperative that you keep an analog or digital calendar. I actually keep both.
