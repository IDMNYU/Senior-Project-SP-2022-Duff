**IDM EQUIPMENT ROOM:** [**http://equipment.bxmc.poly.edu/**](http://equipment.bxmc.poly.edu)****

## In the event that the course needs to be offered entirely online for a particular class meeting, we will meet synchronously at the standard class time using Zoom. The zoom link will be posted on the class Slack and included in a calendar invite that I will also send.

## **Course Website**

[https://deangela.gitbook.io/idm-senior-project-sp-2022-duff/](https://deangela.gitbook.io/idm-senior-project-sp-2022-duff/)\
The course website is the official source for all dates and assignments. This syllabus provides a general overview and guideline for the course. All dates and assignments may be subject to change at the discretion of the professor.

## **Course Communication**

[https://idmspsp2022.slack.com](https://idmspsp2022.slack.com)\
Slack will be our primary communication tool. Join with a **nyu.edu** email address only.

Our slack workspace is not just for me. It's for you and the other sections, too. Let's make it our workspace. Free feel to share what has been helping you stay happy, healthy, or productive during this unprecedented time in our #social-lounge slack channel. Also share resources and references with each other. Also, interact with the students in the other sections there as well. You can also direct message any student or faculty member from the other sections on slack. All classes are using the same slack workspace.

## **Welcome to Senior Project In Digital Media!**

**What is Senior Project in Digital Media?** Senior Project in Digital Media is the capstone course for the Integrated Digital Media (IDM) program. This course mirrors the creative process that professional artists, designers, creative technologists, and entrepreneurs must practice throughout their entire careers. In order to succeed, this course requires you to devote a lot of time and effort outside of class, throughout the entire semester.

The primary goal for the student is to develop a hunger and passion for self-directed, life-long learning, and creativity. To achieve this students will involve themselves in a semester-long capstone project that includes a robust investigation of all phases of the creative process, including research, design, development, and user testing for the production of a substantial and mature body of work, representing their creative and conceptual skills as artists, designers, creative technologists, and/or entrepreneurs.

As you engage in the rigorous practice of a professional artist, designer, or entrepreneur, your project will naturally evolve and change, and may in fact take quite a different shape than what you propose at the beginning of the semester. This is normal and OK.

The Senior Project can take many forms, including but not limited to the following:

* a screen-based, digital application (website, mobile app, game, etc.)
* a physical object, musical instrument, physical game, or interactive installation
* a performance or event,
* a moving image (animation, film, motion graphics, video web series, etc.)
* audio (podcast, etc.)
* print medium

The Senior Project **can also be a team-based project** if your teammate is also taking Senior Project in any section this semester.

## Your Commitment to Senior Project

Excerpt from the book _Anything You Want_ by Derek Sivers

> No “yes.”\
> Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”\
> If you’re not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no.”\
> When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!”\
> —then say “no.”

How are you currently feeling about your Senior Project?

* Yes.
* Absolutely, Yes! or
* No:(

If you are NOT feeling “Absolutely, Yes!” about your senior project, remember your project idea is just that YOURS. I highly suggest you read "What is Senior Project in Digital Media?", again, AND the required and recommended resources NOW!

Senior Project is about the work YOU are and will continue to do when you are no longer a student. You don’t need anyone to whip you to work because you can NOT, not do it. You will live, eat, breathe, and sleep with this project. It is NOT about doing a project for a class or pleasing the IDM faculty. It is about you, your ideas, your concerns, your questions, and your passion.

Senior Project in Digital Media is about demonstrating the maturity, responsibility, and integrity to manage your practice/research/investigation while having the luxury of constructive critique and feedback from your fellow classmates, faculty, and outside critics. **Ultimately, your goal is to COMPLETE a project that has a life beyond school, beyond graduation.**

## Program Goals

The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. Students will:

* develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

## Course Goals

This course will help students to:

* determine, communicate, and accomplish your own vision and goals for your senior project.
* practice an iterative design process in conjunction with effective project & time management skills.
* continue to hone all aspects of professional communication about your creative process and work through discourse, presentations, and writing.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a body of work that is meaningful and carefully crafted to be used for professional purposes (employment, gallery shows, starting a business, etc.) **beyond NYU graduation**.

## Course Structure

This class will consist of individual "one on one" meetings, process and project critiques, [A-Team](assignments/accountability\_partner.md) and class critiques, project demos, and presentations.

**Individual "One on One" Meetings**&#x20;

Be prepared to present and discuss your work at your appointed time. Students should plan ahead and ensure that technical requirements necessary for the review of work are addressed _prior_ to meeting with the instructor. Also, have any required documents ready to go, as well.

Individual meetings are not optional. They are important and useful. Sometimes they are most useful exactly when you feel you have nothing to talk about or show. It is normal that you may sometimes have nothing "good" to show, or even nothing at all. It is still important that you keep your appointment so that we can talk about that. If for some unusual reason you cannot make your appointment one week, please swap times with a classmate.

**Class and A-Team** [**Critiques**](critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/critiques.md)****

## IDM Equipment Room

Senior project students have access to all IDM labs and equipment to support their projects. Students will still need to complete the appropriate lab training and provide proof of insurance when borrowing equipment. Information about each lab can be found at [wp.nyu.edu/idmtech](http://wp.nyu.edu/idmtech).

## Communicating With The Professor Outside Of Class

* Direct message the professor on Slack about logistics (when, where, how many?) ONLY.
* Talk to the professor directly after class, during one of your one-on-one meetings, or set up an appointment at [http://calendly.com/deangela](http://calendly.com/deangela) about issues and problems. DO NOT email long conversations. (If your email turns into paragraphs that means you should be talking to me in person not emailing me.)

## Student Responsibilities

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort).
* Come to class, individual meetings, and special events on time.
* Participate in class critiques and discussions. Be vocal.
* **When your classmates are presenting, please be present and engaged.**
* Consult slack at least once a week for up-to-date info.
* **Back up your work constantly**.
* Complete all deliverables by their due dates.
* Action – do your absolute best.
* Reflection - Any action without reflection is meaningless.
* Iteration - Strive for continuous improvement.
* Pay attention to detail & craft.
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects.
* Have fun!

## Student Values

* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm (to learn, to explore).
* Have self-motivation, proactiveness, and focus.
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline.
* Be creative.
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work!

## Self Assessments

Students will conduct **self-assessments** as well as be evaluated by the professor at [midterm](end\_of\_semester\_deliverables/midterm\_self\_assessment.md) and at the [end of the semester](end\_of\_semester\_deliverables/final\_self\_assessment.md).

Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something.

## Evaluation & Grading

**Attendance**

* Attendance is mandatory at the [Midterm Demo and Critique](critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/midterm-project-demo-instructions.md) and [IDM Student Showcase](critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/idm\_showcase.md).
* Even if you have little or no progress to show, you should still come to class (if not moreso).
* In the event that you need to be out of class, you can see what was covered and what's due for the next class period on this gitbook. You should also speak to your A-team about what you missed.&#x20;
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (direct message on Slack is preferred).

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

**Qualitative Grading Overview**

Each student will be judged on the iteration & improvement (process), craft & completion (execution), and documentation & presentation of their senior project work.

*   **A Excellent**

    Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of the student have been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class, exceeding expectations.
*   **B Very Good / Good**

    Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of students have been, good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average sensitivity to senior project and meets expectations.
*   **C Satisfactory**

    Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of the students have been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of senior project.
*   **D Poor / Below Average**

    Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of the student have been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many areas that show any understanding of senior project. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, and/or poor time management.
*   **F Unacceptable**

    Process, execution, documentation & presentation, and attendance of the student have been such that the student has failed course requirements. Work shows no overall understanding of senior project on many levels, and/or a severe lack of interest.

## Academic Honesty

Please review [NYU Tandon's academic dishonesty policy](https://engineering.nyu.edu/campus-and-community/student-life/office-student-affairs/policies/student-code-conduct) in its entirety.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual style for citing and documenting source material.

You MUST have complete rights of use to any and all materials which appear in your senior project. This includes images, illustrations, audio, etc. The source of any materials NOT created by you MUST be documented. Please remember that you can collaborate with other students to create your own media or contact the authors of your media selections for rights. I strongly encourage you to use original media for your senior project, however, should you absolutely require to use stock images, video, etc., you will need to provide a PDF of all source files and the usage rights you have purchased/negotiated or whether it is creative commons or copyright free.
