Project Demo Deliverables:

* **REVISE your** [**project demo**](../critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/project\_demo.md) **** or link(s) and supporting files and post them on [https://padlet.com/dd1849/idmspdemos](https://padlet.com/dd1849/idmspdemos) **by noon on Monday, March 15 at the very latest** so your classmates can make comments about your project demo revisions. You should be able to edit your previous padlet posts.
* **Comment on 3 additional classmates' project demos** by adding a comment or card with your name as the title (unless you create a padlet account and are logged in. We need to know whose comments are which) underrneath the column of the classmate project demo you are commenting on.
  * What is working about the project?
  * What is confusing or needs more clarification about the project? Questions?
  * What are ways that the project can be improved? Suggestions?
  * What additional references, resources, projects, and/or links would be useful for this project?

Project Demo Info & Resources:

* Because each student is working on individual projects, your [project demo](../critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/project\_demo.md) may vary, but you need to show something visible and concrete.&#x20;
* You can also show multiple things for your project demo. Put each one in a separate padlet card (see link below).
* The majority of you are working on either UI/UX for websites or apps or animations/videos. Make sure you review the [Design & Production Workflow (AKA Pipeline) ](../design-and-production-workflow.md)resources.
* For UI/UX for websites and apps, your project demo could include user workflow, user journey, and/or customer journey, sitemaps, wireframes/schematics, and/or clickable prototypes in the software of your choice.&#x20;
  * This is an example of a good wireframe: [https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf](https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf) with the exception of the one paragraph of lorem ipsum text. Also do not use color.
* For animations/videos, your project demo could include storyboards, style frames, animatics, audio, and/or motion tests. &#x20;
* If you're working on a game, you could include the story, character & other object sketches, interaction tests, levels, maps, puzzles, etc.&#x20;

## **Class**

**First hour in Carla Gannis' Zoom Room:**&#x20;

* We'll be visiting another section of Senior Projects (Carla Gannis') for a talk by \
  Kelsa Trom, Head of Programs at [NEW INC](https://www.newinc.org/our-story).\
  Kelsa Trom is a writer and cultural organizer focused on participatory learning and community. She brings a multidisciplinary background across service design, communications, education, strategy, and research with a  focus on driving social change through art and design. Her projects in ceramics, writing experiments, and movement arts explore the interplay between the body, public and private gestures, memory, and everyday life.\
  \
  She will be discussing the mission of NEW INC as a creative incubator for artists, designers, creative technologists, and activists to fully produce and implement their visions. Also, the programming that she organizes to offer as inspiration or catalyst for creatives in the program to find strategies and means to produce their dream projects.

**Second hour in our usual zoom room:**

> "Greatness is consistency.\
> Meditating once is common. Meditating daily is rare.\
> Exercising today is simple. Training every week is simply remarkable.\
> Writing one essay rarely matters. Write every day and you're practically a hero.\
> Unheroic days can make for heroic decades." \
> James Clear
