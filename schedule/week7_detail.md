## Deliverables (DUE ON DATE LISTED)

Project Demo Deliverables:

* **REVISE your** [**project demo**](../critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/project\_demo.md) **** or link(s) and supporting files and post them on {padlet URL here} **by noon on Monday, March 21 at the very latest** so your classmates can make comments about your project demo revisions. You should be able to edit your previous padlet posts.
* **Comment on 3 additional classmates' project demos** by adding a comment or card with your name as the title (unless you create a padlet account and are logged in. We need to know whose comments are which) underrneath the column of the classmate project demo you are commenting on.
  * What is working about the project?
  * What is confusing or needs more clarification about the project? Questions?
  * What are ways that the project can be improved? Suggestions?
  * What additional references, resources, projects, and/or links would be useful for this project?

Project Demo Info & Resources:

* Because each student is working on individual projects, your [project demo](../critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/project\_demo.md) may vary, but you need to show something visible and concrete.&#x20;
* You can also show multiple things for your project demo. Put each one in a separate padlet card (see link below).
* The majority of you are working on either UI/UX for websites or apps or animations/videos. Make sure you review the [Design & Production Workflow (AKA Pipeline) ](../design-and-production-workflow.md)resources.
* For UI/UX for websites and apps, your project demo could include user workflow, user journey, and/or customer journey, sitemaps, wireframes/schematics, and/or clickable prototypes in the software of your choice.&#x20;
  * This is an example of a good wireframe: [https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf](https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf) with the exception of the one paragraph of lorem ipsum text. Also do not use color.
* For animations/videos, your project demo could include storyboards, style frames, animatics, audio, and/or motion tests. &#x20;
* If you're working on a game, you could include the story, character & other object sketches, interaction tests, levels, maps, puzzles, etc.&#x20;

The Usual Weekly Deliverables:

* Meet with your [accountability team ](../assignments/accountability\_partner.md)at least once, this week.&#x20;
