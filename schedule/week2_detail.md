# Week 2 Detail Jan 31

> Vision is the bottleneck of talent. Most talent is wasted because people do not clearly know what they want. Itâ€™s not a lack of effort but a lack of direction. There are many capable people in the world, but relatively few that focus on what matters. \~James Clear

<summary>Busy vs. Productive</summary>

Being productive does not mean working 24/7. It means working effectively within the shortest amount of time.

* Being busy feels urgent. Being productive feels effective.
* Being busy is frantic and multitasking. Being productive is focused.
* Being busy is working harder. Being productive is working smarter.
* **Being busy is fueled by perfectionism. Being productive is fueled by purpose.**
* **Being busy says yes quickly and takes on more than one can handle. Being productive thinks carefully before taking on more tasks.**
* **Being busy talks about the little time they have. Being productive makes time for what is important.**
