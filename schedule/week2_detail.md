# Week 2 Detail Jan 31

> Vision is the bottleneck of talent. Most talent is wasted because people do not clearly know what they want. Itâ€™s not a lack of effort but a lack of direction. There are many capable people in the world, but relatively few that focus on what matters. \~James Clear

## Deliverables (DUE ON DATE LISTED)

* Read [letters from a previous cohort](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fr1cw72xTrvwSBTM6Bh9OU2XepJ1YNOk) (if you didn't last week).
* Write a [response](../assignments/responses.md) to 1 or more of the letters from the previous cohort and post it in the #duff slack channel. Did you notice any trends? What are 1 to 3 key takeaways for you? What advice will you take to heart? I'm sure different letters will resonate with different students. Make sure you read as many as you can.
* Read [Epicenter Design](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/09.2-epicenter-design) (1min) and post your response to your process website or the "duff" slack channel. The point of assigning this reading is not about building websites. How can you translate this reading to your medium? What is the epicenter of your concept? What is the epicenter of your story? What is the epicenter of your medium?
* (if applicable) Iterate [project plan](../project\_plan/)
