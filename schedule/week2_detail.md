> Vision is the bottleneck of talent. Most talent is wasted because people do not clearly know what they want. Itâ€™s not a lack of effort but a lack of direction. There are many capable people in the world, but relatively few that focus on what matters. \~James Clear

## Deliverables (DUE ON DATE LISTED)

* Read [letters from a previous cohort](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fr1cw72xTrvwSBTM6Bh9OU2XepJ1YNOk)&#x20;
* Write a [response](../assignments/responses.md) to 1 or more of the letters from the previous cohort and post it in the #duff slack channel. Did you notice any trends? What are 1 to 3 key takeaways for you? What advice will you take to heart? I'm sure different letters will resonate with different students. Make sure you read as many as you can.
* Read the assigned, selected chapters from [_Getting Real_](../assignments/getting-real-readings.md).&#x20;
* Write a [response](../assignments/responses.md) to the 3 chapters that resonated with you the most.
* Iterate [project plan](../project\_plan/)
