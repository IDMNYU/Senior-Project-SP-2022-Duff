There's still 4 of you who need to submit them. It is a small part of your grade. 2.5%. Check the <a href="../syllabus.md">syllabus</a>. <br><br>If we can get 100% submission, you will not need to send me proof that you did it. If we don't get 100% submission, you'll need to direct message me on Slack with a screenshot of the completion confirmation of the course evaluation.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
