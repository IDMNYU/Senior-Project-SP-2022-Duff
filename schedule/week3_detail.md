# Week 3 Detail Feb 18

## Deliverables (DUE ON DATE LISTED)

* Read [letters from a previous cohort](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fr1cw72xTrvwSBTM6Bh9OU2XepJ1YNOk) (if you didn't last week). I also added some additional ones from Spring 2020.
  * Write a [response](../assignments/responses.md) to 1 or more of the letters from the previous cohort and post it in the #duff slack channel. Did you notice any trends? What are 1 to 3 key takeaways for you? What advice will you take to heart? I'm sure different letters will resonate with different students. Make sure you read as many as you can.
* **Miro board** (link pinned in #duff slack channel. Also emailed you access.)&#x20;
  * Miro is a collaborative whiteboard. It's pretty intuitive to use. However, here is a [youtube tutorial ](https://youtu.be/pULLAEmhSho?t=263)if you want one.&#x20;
  * Hover over the toolbar to the left in Miro's interface to quickly get a sense of what each tool does.&#x20;
  * The Comment tool looks like a quote. It's the 8th icon from the top of the left toolbar.
  * The Zoom tool is in the bottom right hand corner of the interface. Hover over the percentage and you'll be able to see + and - signs. There are also key commands to zoom in and out (control + and - on the mac).&#x20;
  * Click inside a sticky note on our Miro board to edit it.&#x20;
* Feel free to edit YOUR Miro column
  * Feel free to change the color of your post-its in YOUR Miro column.
