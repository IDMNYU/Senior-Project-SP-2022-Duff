* Take advantage of [NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/career-development-and-jobs.html?\_\_s=pvit1odzgzycp3tif89s)'s virtual events, 30 min virtual career coaching appointments, 15min virtual drop-ins, etc.
* **Students** can get free headshots from the [NYU Photo Bureau](https://www.nyu.edu/employees/resources-and-services/media-and-communications/photo-services/in-studio-headshots.html). I highly recommend that you take advantage of it for your portfolio website and LinkedIn profile. It's a very popular service. You just need to book it (sometimes weeks) in advance. Obviously, COVID-19 may affect their availability this semester.
