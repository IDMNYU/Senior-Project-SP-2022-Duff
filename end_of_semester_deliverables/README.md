# End of Semester Deliverables

At the beginning of the semester, create a google drive folder labeled "Senior Project SP21 your first and last name" (i.e. Senior Project SP21 De Angela Duff) and share with deangela.duff@nyu.edu.

Over the course of the semester, you should upload the corresponding files and folders.

NEW:

* [Project Documentation](project\_documentation.md) folder
* [Final Self-assessment](final\_self\_assessment.md) pdf
* [Letter To Next Cohort](letter\_to\_next\_cohort.md) file&#x20;

OLD: You should already have the following. Just drag and drop in the folder if you haven't already.

* [Pecha Kucha presentation](../assignments/pecha\_kucha.md) exported as a pdf
* [Project Plan](../project\_plan/) presentation exported as a pdf
* [Pro Practices Revisions](pro\_practices\_revisions.md): sample cover letter and resume
* [Midterm Self-assessment](midterm\_self\_assessment.md) pdf
* [Project Presentation](../critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/project-presentation.md) (if applicable)
