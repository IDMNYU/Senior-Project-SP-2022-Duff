# Pro Practices Revisions

> Vision is the bottleneck of talent. Most talent is wasted because people do not clearly know what they want. It’s not a lack of effort but a lack of direction. There are many capable people in the world, but relatively few that focus on what matters. \~James Clear

Iterate the following from professional practices and post some of the following to this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aj\_Ndn2\_Ta5vR3Wimq8ggmWXBnAGcPU4TmGQjdjz6Lc/edit):

<details>

<summary>Portfolio Website</summary>

This website should market and promote your entire body of work _including your senior project_ for possible employment or other post graduation opportunities. Ideally, you should have your own domain name. I suggest getting your own domain name through an ISP (Internet Service Provider. I recommend [Siteground](http://siteground.com) or [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com).&#x20;

* An example: [https://www.glorialo.design](https://www.glorialo.design)
