# Storytelling Exercise

## Audio (Optional) / Visual (Required) Storytelling Exercise

* Please note that this is an optional exercise for brainstorming.
* Create a [pecha kucha presentation](../critiques-demos-presentations-and-exhibition/pecha\_kucha.md) using 1 of the 2 prompts below.
* Record audio by recording through zoom or write notes for each image in the notes section of google notes.
* Export as a pdf with notes (if you do not want to include audio) or download video if you include audio.&#x20;
* Upload to your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](../end\_of\_semester\_deliverables/).

Select 20 images that create a visual story about your project idea (no text). One image per screen. Be prepared to talk **briefly** about each image you select (20 seconds goes by fast).

There are two options:

* **If you already have a project idea,** this audio (optional), visual (required) presentation should cover all perspectives, concepts, and ideas you can think about. Donâ€™t limit yourself but broaden up.
* **If you do not have a specific project,** select 20 things that you consider relevant for living in 2022 or 20 things that you are interested in.
