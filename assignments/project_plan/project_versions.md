# Project Versions

The specific parameters and expectations of each version will be individually determined in consultation with the professor except for the teaser.

* **A teaser** contains the ideas, vision, and story behind your project in a 1 to 3 minute video. You will use the contents of your [project plan](./) to create your teaser. The main requirement will be your elevator pitch which is your concept + primary audience + medium. You decide what else you want to include. It can be live-action video, an animation/motion graphics, text only or a combination! You choose. This can also be done in powerpoint, keynote, or google slides. You can export any of these as a video. Post these on padlet.
* **Preview** is when your project is ready for user testing.
* **Launch** is when all the bugs in your project have been fixed and quality is assured. It is ready to go public. It is ready to be "shipped" and consumed by the public.

## Feedback Through User Testing

You should be conducting research and user testing throughout the ENTIRE semester. Do not wait until the last minute to begin user testing; User testing gives you invaluable feedback about your project.
