## Reflection

Any action without reflection is meaningless; real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything; it involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. In any learning situation, you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again. Learning happens in a cycle, illustrated in the diagrams below.

As a student, you should also develop your critical thinking skills. This will initially involve critiquing other peopleâ€™s work but ultimately you also want to be able to critique your own work. This will allow you to develop as a creator.

**Of Project**

Critically analyze/evaluate your senior project **final execution**.

* What qualitative description would you give the final execution of your project so far and why?&#x20;
  * &#x20;(i.e. excellent, very good, good, etc. Consult the grading overview descriptions presented earlier in this syllabus.)
* Do your deliverables match your initial concept (or last impact statement)?
* Did you do what you said you were going to do (integrity, accountability)?
* Did you execute all aspects of your project by the best means possible (craft and care)?
* Lessons Learned / What would you do differently if you could redo this project?

**Of Process**

Critically analyze/evaluate your senior project **process.**

* How did you approach your project? Did you focus on the forest (entire project as a whole) or the trees (details) at first? When did you transition to the other IF you did?
* Did you manage your time properly?
* Did you prioritize effectively?
*   What qualitative description would you give your overall **process** and why?&#x20;

    * (i.e. excellent, very good, good, etc. Consult the grading overview descriptions presented earlier in this syllabus.)
