## Reflection

Any action without reflection is meaningless; real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything; it involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. In any learning situation, you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again. Learning happens in a cycle, illustrated in the diagrams below.

As a student, you should also develop your critical thinking skills. This will initially involve critiquing other peopleâ€™s work but ultimately you also want to be able to critique your own work. This will allow you to develop as a creator.

**Of Project**

* Critically describe and analyze/evaluate your senior project **process**. What have you learned about yourself and your working habits through this project so far? Time management, strengths, weaknesses, preferences, needs, etc.
* At this point in time, what qualitative description would you give your overall **process** and why? (i.e. excellent, very good, good, etc. Consult the grading overview descriptions presented earlier in the [syllabus](../../syllabus.md).
* Reflect upon your **project's development progress** at this point in time.
  * Give a brief description of the project and the work you have done thus far. List using bullet points if needed.
  * Describe the parts of the project you have yet to complete.
  * What are your open issues (if any)?
  * What do you like about your project or research so far? What have you been able to do well?
  * What have you struggled with (if at all)? Why? Identify any specific hurdles you are dealing with (if any).
* What feedback about your project (from anyone including students from the midterm demo) has been the most useful to you and why? What feedback has not been useful to you (if any)?
* At this point in time, what qualitative description would you give your overall **project development progress** and why? (i.e. excellent, very good, good, etc. Consult the grading overview descriptions presented earlier in the [syllabus](../../syllabus.md).
* What are your risks of failure (lack of tech, time, knowledge, money, etc.)?
* Create a contingency plan for major risks.
