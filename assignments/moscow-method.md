# Project Scope: MoSCoW Method

The scope of your project is key. Hone in on the scope of your project by using the [MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW\_method)**.**&#x20;

Create a google doc in your senior project folder and brainstorm the following or put it in your [project management](website.md) platform:

M - _Must have_ project features\
S - _Should have_ project features\
C - _Could have_ project features\
W - _Won't have project features_
