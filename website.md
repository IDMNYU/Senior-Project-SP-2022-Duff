![Progress > Perfection Illustration by Jolby from Get To Work Book.](<.gitbook/assets/GETTOWORKBOOK\_progress perfection (1).jpg>)

Please add your name and the URL of your process website to this [shared google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y3DCwp7kZoMx-zMVO6IMVDuD9AUpfTLV2gx7sPXTd7U/edit).

You should have a **dedicated**, project management platform for your **daily** and/or **weekly** process and progress of your senior project. Students are expected to share their process and progress with others using their project management platform.

## What your project management platform should contain?

* Daily/Weekly senior project process & progress (AKA what have you done today or this week?)&#x20;
* at least, 1 post per week DUE by or before noon on Mondays. If it is not posted by noon, you will not receive credit for this week.
* Make sure to use tags so that you can group certain kinds of info.
  * [Milestones / tasks](resources/personal\_kanban.md) that have been completed (either transcribed or linked from your personal kanban or a screenshot or photo).
  * Include who or what was involved.
  * Include project progress and prototyping documentation: images, illustrations, audio, video, code, snippets of research, ANNOTATED links, etc. relevant to your thesis.&#x20;
  * Accountability partner meeting notes.
  * Document any feedback from interviews, meetings, exhibitions, or presentations about your project.
  * pdfs of any presentations (annotated).
  * Notes taken about your project, prototypes, and presentations by you or your accountability partner.
  * Notes on problems, challenges, or questions that have arisen in your project development. Discuss what is and what is not working.
* _Sourced & Annotated Research / Reference / Inspiration_
  * Research: If you found projects, books, articles, exhibitions, talks. or other research materials that help with your chosen topic or you conducted materials, tech, or visual research, provide a link to them (if applicable), photo or video documentation (if applicable), and a short written description of it and how you will use this research for your project.
  * Sourced means where did you get this from? if it is a website, provide a link. If it is a book, provide a bibliography. If it is an image, where did you get it from? If it is a quote, who said it, or who did you poll or interview?
  * Annotated means with notes. You don’t have to write a novel. 1 to 2 thoughtful, contextual sentences are more than enough. So, “This was inspirational,” would not be a good note as it provides no context for your thesis. However, “This book discusses how nostalgia is a useless emotion because nostalgia is based on the past. This point of view is antithetical to my thesis because I’m trying to demonstrate how the sentimentality of nostalgia is valuable to the human experience.” is a viable note.)
