&#x20;**May 11, 2021, Exact Time 4-9:30pm EDT**&#x20;

Participation is MANDATORY for the end-of-semester showcase!!

At a minimum, the following materials are due on **April 23, 2021**:

1\) A one to two minute video that explains your project \
2\) a URL to view the project (can be a video link, documentation, live site, etc) \
3\) an image that represents the project (can be of the thing itself, a graphic treatment, etc) \
4\) text describing the project \
5\) project title

Students may also submit additional media- images, videos- as appropriate.

**Here's** [**additional info about the requirements**](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/idmshow) **and** [**a form to sign up for opening night**](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/idmshow/submission-form?authuser=0) **which is a requirement for this class. As we discussed, the student showcase is a part of your grade.** \

**You can see submissions from last semester here:** [**http://idm.show/F2020/**](http://idm.show/F2020/)\
\
We know that many of the projects will not be fully completed before the end of the semester which is why we are asking for a static URL to view the completed work. All the other materials need to be completed by the submission date - they would be able to work on the content of the site up until the day of the show itself.\
\
We are also going to ask senior project students to participate in live discussions about their work on May 11. Last semester this was a great way for them to publicly talk about their process and prototypes for a wider audience. We encourage students to invite friends, family, and colleagues to watch these discussions. Last year, we had over 2000 viewers over the course of the day.&#x20;

Your senior project will be publicly shown in the IDM showcase at the end of the semester. Exhibiting your work is truly a gift of accomplishment, response, and feedback.

* **Show Your Work:** Your project should be as complete as humanly possible. You will exhibit your senior project publicly in the IDM Showcase. If you don't understand the importance and benefits of exhibiting your work, I HIGHLY recommend that you read [Show Your Work!](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered-ebook/dp/B00GU2RGGI/ref=sr\_1\_1?ie=UTF8\&qid=1420589663\&sr=8-1\&keywords=show+the+work+austin+kleon) by Austin Kleon NOW ([Cheat Sheet](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1384352860i/6856374.\_SY540\_.jpg)).
