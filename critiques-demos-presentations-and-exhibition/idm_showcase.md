**You can see submissions from last semester here:** [**http://idm.show/F2021/**](http://idm.show/F2021/)

Your senior project will be publicly shown in the IDM showcase at the end of the semester. Exhibiting your work is truly a gift of accomplishment, response, and feedback.

* **Show Your Work:** Your project should be as complete as humanly possible. You will exhibit your senior project publicly in the IDM Showcase. If you don't understand the importance and benefits of exhibiting your work, I HIGHLY recommend that you read [Show Your Work!](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered-ebook/dp/B00GU2RGGI/ref=sr\_1\_1?ie=UTF8\&qid=1420589663\&sr=8-1\&keywords=show+the+work+austin+kleon) by Austin Kleon NOW ([Cheat Sheet](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1384352860i/6856374.\_SY540\_.jpg)).
