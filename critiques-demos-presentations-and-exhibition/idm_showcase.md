Participation is MANDATORY for the end-of-semester showcase!! The student showcase is a part of your grade.

## Submit to the IDM Showcase

Here's the submission form for the IDM senior showcase. **You must fill out this form by April 20, 2022.** Your participation in the show is a requirement for this class. Late submissions will not be allowed so be sure to submit it by the deadline: [https://forms.gle/NBP4o1aGsjAXDar99](https://forms.gle/NBP4o1aGsjAXDar99)

At a minimum, the following materials are due on **April 20, 2022**:

* A URL to view the project (can be a video link, documentation, live site, etc)&#x20;
* an image that represents the project (can be of the thing itself, a graphic treatment, etc)&#x20;
* text describing the project&#x20;
* project title

Students may also submit additional media- images, videos- as appropriate.

**You can see submissions from last semester here:** [**http://idm.show/F2021/**](http://idm.show/F2021/)

## Participate in the IDM Showcase

* It will be science fair style, meaning most students will be presenting from their laptop.
* Equipment will be available for students to use on a case by case basis (primarily determined by Dylan who is managing the install/ hardware distribution).
* IF students have a physical installation or are using IDM equipment the installation/ equipment borrowing will occur earlier that same day and deinstall/ clean up/ returning of equipment will occur directly afterward.
* Students can have 1 non-NYU person attend the event. While some of the info on the form can be edited after the submission, because of the bureaucracy around bringing people on to campus, the outside guest will not be able to be changed after the April 20th submission.

Your senior project will be publicly shown in the IDM showcase at the end of the semester. Exhibiting your work is truly a gift of accomplishment, response, and feedback.

* **Show Your Work:** Your project should be as complete as humanly possible. You will exhibit your senior project publicly in the IDM Showcase. If you don't understand the importance and benefits of exhibiting your work, I HIGHLY recommend that you read [Show Your Work!](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered-ebook/dp/B00GU2RGGI/ref=sr\_1\_1?ie=UTF8\&qid=1420589663\&sr=8-1\&keywords=show+the+work+austin+kleon) by Austin Kleon NOW ([Cheat Sheet](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1384352860i/6856374.\_SY540\_.jpg)).
