# Critiques



**Class and team critiques**

Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the aural, visual, and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Have at least your [accountability group](../assignments/accountability\_partner.md) or another classmate take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.

**Rules of the critique:**

* Be present and engaged.
* Give feedback to your classmates.
* Do not make assumptions. Ask questions.
* Do your best.
* Do NOT take feedback personally.
* Be impeccable with your word.

## ****[**Liz Lerman's Critical Response Process**](https://lizlerman.com/critical-response-process/) ****&#x20;

### Role 1: Artist/Maker

Offers a work-in-progress for review and feels prepared to question that work in a dialogue with other people.

### Role 2: Responder

Engages in dialogue with the artist, with a commitment to the artist’s intent to make excellent work.

### Role 3: Facilitator

Initiates each step, keeps the process on track, and works to help the artist and responders use the process to frame useful questions and responses.

### Role 1: Artist/Maker (Student Presenting)

Offers a work-in-progress for review and feels prepared to question that work in a dialogue with other people.

### Role 2: Responder (Students who are currently not presenting)

Engages in dialogue with the artist, with a commitment to the artist’s intent to make excellent work.

### Role 3: Facilitator (Professor)

Initiates each step, keeps the process on track, and works to help the artist and responders use the process to frame useful questions and responses.



## Step 1. Statements of Meaning&#x20;

### (What is working about the project?)

Responders state what was meaningful, evocative, interesting, exciting, and/or striking in the work they have just witnessed.

## Step 2. Artist as Questioner

The artist asks questions about the work. In answering, responders stay on topic with the question and may express opinions in direct response to the artist’s questions.

## Step 3. Neutral Questions&#x20;

### (What is confusing or needs more clarification about the project?)

Responders ask neutral questions about the work, and the artist responds. Questions are neutral when they do not have an opinion couched in them.

This step is one of the most fundamental, challenging, and misunderstood steps of Critical Response Process.

## Step 4. Feedback Time&#x20;

### (What are ways that the project can be improved? What additional references, resources, projects, and/or links would be useful for the project?)

Responders state feedback. (This deviates substantially from Liz Lerman's process.)
