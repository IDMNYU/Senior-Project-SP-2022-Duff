# Midterm Project Demo

**Attendance for the Midterm Project Demo is MANDATORY on both dates.**

## **Midterm Project Demo Prep**

* IF you haven't already, please sign up for a [padlet](http://padlet.com) account so your name will be attributed to your comments.&#x20;
* You will find the group # and padlet you're assigned to in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nx6sCKFbDKpJ-pLjxW8kxPVdncsN0axpombmY8k875g/edit?usp=sharing).
* **By or before Sunday, March 28, 2021, at noon EST**, please document your prototype(s) by posting the link(s) directly to the thing itself if it is a website (incl. soundcloud links), social media feed (instagram, etc), animatic or animation on vimeo or youtube, etc to your group's respective padlet.&#x20;
* You can also show multiple assets for your project demo. Put each one in a separate padlet card.
* The calendar invite will contain the link where we'll meet online in Airmeet. I'll also post it on slack.
* **Please look at the prototype(s) of the students in your group BEFORE 2pm on midterm project demo day and leave comments for everyone in your assigned group at least.** Also, leave comments for other groups if you look at their projects. If everyone does this, you can spend less time talking and showing your project and more time getting feedback on your project.

## Midterm Project Demo Info & Resources:

* Because each student is working on individual projects, your [project demo](project\_demo.md) may vary, but you need to show something visible and concrete.&#x20;
* The majority of you are working on either UI/UX for websites or apps or animations/videos. Make sure you review the [Design & Production Workflow (AKA Pipeline) ](../design-and-production-workflow.md)resources.
* For UI/UX for websites and apps, your project demo could include user workflow, user journey, and/or customer journey, sitemaps, wireframes/schematics, and/or clickable prototypes in the software of your choice.&#x20;
  * This is an example of a good wireframe: [https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf](https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf) with the exception of the one paragraph of lorem ipsum text. Also do not use color.
* For animations/videos, your project demo could include storyboards, style frames, animatics, audio, and/or motion tests. &#x20;
* If you're working on a game, you could include the story, character & other object sketches, interaction tests, levels, maps, puzzles, etc.&#x20;

## **Midterm Project Roles**

* IF you have been assigned a **timekeeper** or **chat moderator** and you are HIGHLY uncomfortable in doing so, please let me know ASAP. However, I want all students to participate actively during our midterm project demos.

## **Midterm Project Demo**

* Think of this as a show and tell.
* Be prepared to deliver an elevator pitch of your project verbally.&#x20;
* Be prepared to demo the project at its current state.&#x20;
* When you share your prototype(s) to your group during your midterm demo, try to bypass showing it on your process website. In other words, if you have images just show the images using preview, etc. If you have created a website, animatic or animation on vimeo or youtube, etc, go directly to that link in a web browser. Alternatively, you can click on your padlet note and **go fullscreen**.
* Discuss what does (and does not) your prototype(s) explore at this moment in time. Quickly list next steps.&#x20;
* Come with questions to ask others about your project direction(s).
* You will have 14 min total to deliver your elevator pitch, demo your project, AND receive feedback from the group.
  * You will have up to 5 min to deliver your elevator pitch and demo your project. You do not need to use the entire 5 min. That way you'll have more time for feedback.
  * The remaining time will be used for the rest of your group to give you feedback.
  * The focus is on the actual artifact(s) you are creating and nothing else.
  * **Do NOT create a supporting presentation.**
* Also, make sure to also document your prototype(s) on your [process website](../website.md) by creating post(s) which contain the link(s), photo(s), and/or video(s) of your prototype(s). More details below about demoing.

## **Midterm Project Demo Setup**

* All four sections will be meeting together in one Airmeet. There will be 11 tables of groups of 5 or 6.
* Faculty and any "outside of our class" critics may or may not table hop.
* Each Airmeet table will be assigned a student timekeeper, chat monitor, and a student to take screenshots of the chat.
  * Once you see the assignments and you are uncomfortable with being either the timekeeper, chat monitor, or with taking screenshots let the faculty know.
* Every student should have 14 min total to be fair.&#x20;
* Recap: Each student should present for up to 5 min and have the remaining time for feedback for a total of 14 min.

## Reminders

* You should **look at and comment on your group's padlet BEFORE Monday at 2pm of everyone in your group**.&#x20;
* Make sure you do not use a presentation to describe your project.
* Make sure you present the prototype(s) itself.
* Make sure your elevator pitch is just that. Short. 1 to 2 sentences maximum.
* Make sure you spend the bulk of your 5 min presenting your prototype(s).
* Make sure you share your screen when you are presenting your prototype(s).
  * Make sure you select fullscreen on padlet to show your prototype(s).
* Use your entire 14 min. If students are not giving you feedback, ask them questions you are currently grappling with.
* Give feedback to everybody at your table if at all possible.
* Do not just let the IDM grad student(s) or faculty talk.
* There should be peer-to-peer feedback.

## **Rules of the critique:**

* Do your best.
* Be present and engaged.
* Give feedback to your classmates.&#x20;
* Do not make assumptions. Ask questions.
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

## **Guidelines for giving feedback during the critique:**

* What is working about the project?
* What is confusing or needs more clarification about the project? (Questions)
* What are ways that the project can be improved? (Suggestions)
* What additional references, resources, projects, and/or links would be useful for this project?

## Getting Feedback

* Document your feedback ASAP (preferably by the following day at the latest )
* Always document any feedback you receive on your [process website](../website.md) after any critique. The midterm project demo is no different.&#x20;
  * This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project (prototype(s)), a description of your project progress as it currently stands, and a discussion of the feedback you received from the critique.
    * How will this feedback improve your project and progress?
    * Evaluate whether the prototype(s) gave you the feedback you require to transform or move forward with your project. If not, reflect upon why not.

## **Giving feedback**

Please share any resources or references you suggest to your group and other senior project students on padlet.

## Invite guests

It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to _at least_ one of their project critiques, demos, or presentations. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. If you are inviting an outside critic, please email me their name, title, company or org, and their email so I can send them a google calendar invite.

A one on one, documented meeting (date, time, length, and typed notes) with the outside critic can substitute for their presence at a project critique. Also, have the outside critic email me to confirm that they actually met with you.
