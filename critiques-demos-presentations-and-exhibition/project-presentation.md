## Presentation Resources

* [Speaking.io](http://speaking.io)
* [Advice on Public Speaking from Zach Lieberman](https://medium.com/@zachlieberman/advice-on-public-talks-a984876388c2)
* [Jer Thorp, Three things Iâ€™ve learned from 18 years of public speaking](https://medium.com/@blprnt/the-three-things-i-learned-from-eighteen-years-of-public-speaking-875f01178902)&#x20;

## Focus on Showing & Telling, as opposed to just Telling

* Despite giving an accompanying presentation with or without slides, your actual project should be the primary focus of any project presentation.
* With many presentations, people talk about their project, but spend either less time or no time showing us their actual project.&#x20;
* In other words, it's better to integrate the talking with the showing of your project instead of having a separate slideshow.&#x20;
* If you choose to create a separate slideshow make sure it's image-heavy as opposed to text-heavy.&#x20;
* Use the [project plan](../assignments/project\_plan.md) sections as a template for your oral or visual presentation. The project plan is just a guideline for information for your presentation. It is up to you to decide which areas you want to focus on. In some cases, you might omit a section if you think the class remembers key ideas from your previous presentation.
* Post the link in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EfXgca1QsOS6xNGzMvSjeAmHDSRgqK2bK1CTrJRPoNU/edit) before class begins to an accompanying slideshow **or your project** if you will be speaking primarily through showing your project (which is recommended).

Each presentation will consist of:

* 7 minutes of presentation&#x20;
* (OPTIONAL) If you choose to create an accompanying slideshow please use google slides, prezi, or a platform that can be shared via a URL.

## Document your feedback

Always document any feedback you receive on your [project management platform](../assignments/website.md) after any critique. This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project (prototype or version), a description of your project progress as it currently stands, and discussion of the feedback your received from the critique. How will this feedback improve your work and ideas?
