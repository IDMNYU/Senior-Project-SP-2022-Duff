# Project Demos

![Keep Going Illustration by Jolby from Gettoworkbook](<../.gitbook/assets/gettoworkbook keep going.png>)

Project Demos will be held on designated Mondays, and will consist of the professor, ALL students, and outside critics, at times.

Each demo will consist of:

* 7 minutes of presentation and&#x20;
*   7 minutes of Q\&A

    (or a combination thereof)

    for 14 minutes total.

Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and/or your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea.

* Have a member of your accountability team take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not.&#x20;
* Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said.
* Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise.&#x20;
* However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.&#x20;

**Rules of the critique:**

* Be present and engaged.
* Give feedback to your classmates.&#x20;
* Do not make assumptions. Ask questions.
* Do your best.
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

**Guidelines for the critique:**

* What is working about the project?
* What is confusing or needs more clarification about the project? Questions?
* What are ways that the project can be improved? Suggestions?
* What additional references, resources, projects, and/or links would be useful for this project?

## Additional Guidelines for your Project Demo

* You will demo the project in its current state.
* The focus is on the actual artifact you are creating and nothing else.
* Do NOT create a supporting presentation.

### Be prepared to discuss the following for your Project Demo

From Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill's _What do Prototypes prototype?_, prototypes provide a means to examine design problems.

* What does (and does not) your prototype explore at this moment in time?
* Evaluate whether the prototype gives you the feedback you require to transform or move forward with your project.
* What are your next steps?

### Invite guests

It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to _at least_ one of their project critiques, demos, or presentations. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. A one on one, documented meeting (date, time, length, and typed notes) with the outside critic can substitute for their presence at a project critique. Also, have the outside critic email me to confirm that they actually met with you.

### Document your feedback

Always document any feedback you receive on your [process website](../website.md) after any critique. This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project (prototype or version), a description of your project progress as it currently stands, and discussion of the feedback you received from the critique. How will this feedback improve your work and ideas?

### Project Demo Info & Resources:

* Because each student is working on individual projects, your [project demo](project\_demo.md) may vary, but you need to show something visible and concrete.&#x20;
* You can also show multiple things for your project demo. Put each one in a separate padlet card (link on slack).
* The majority of you are working on either UI/UX for websites or apps or animations/videos. Make sure you review the [Design & Production Workflow (AKA Pipeline) ](../design-and-production-workflow.md)resources.
* For UI/UX for websites and apps, your project demo could include user workflow, user journey, and/or customer journey, sitemaps, wireframes/schematics, and/or clickable prototypes in the software of your choice.&#x20;
  * This is an example of a good wireframe: [https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf](https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf) with the exception of the one paragraph of lorem ipsum text. Also do not use color.
* For animations/videos, your project demo could include storyboards, style frames, animatics, audio, and/or motion tests. &#x20;
* If you're working on a game, you could include the story, character & other object sketches, interaction tests, levels, maps, puzzles, etc.&#x20;
