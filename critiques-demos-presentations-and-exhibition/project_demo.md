![Keep Going Illustration by Jolby from Gettoworkbook](<../.gitbook/assets/gettoworkbook keep going.png>)

Project Demos will be held on designated Mondays. Each demo will consist of:

* Up to 5 minutes max of presentation and&#x20;
* use the remaining time for feedback
* 10 minutes total

Review the rules of the [critiques](critiques.md) (AKA crits).

* Have a member of your accountability team take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not.&#x20;

## Project Demo Info & Resources:

* Because each student is working on individual projects, your [project demo](project\_demo.md) may vary, but you need to show something visible and concrete.&#x20;
* You can also show multiple things for your project demo. Put each one in a separate padlet card (see link below).
* The majority of you are working on either UI/UX for websites or apps or animations/videos. Make sure you review the [Design & Production Workflow (AKA Pipeline) ](../resources/design-and-production-workflow.md)resources.
* For UI/UX for websites and apps, your project demo could include user workflow, user journey, and/or customer journey, sitemaps, wireframes/schematics, and/or clickable prototypes in the software of your choice.&#x20;
  * This is an example of a good wireframe: [https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf](https://fuzzymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Fuzzy-Math-How-to-read-a-wireframe.pdf) with the exception of the one paragraph of lorem ipsum text. Also do not use color.
* For animations/videos, your project demo could include storyboards, style frames, animatics, audio, and/or motion tests. &#x20;
* If you're working on a game, you could include the story, character & other object sketches, interaction tests, levels, maps, puzzles, etc.&#x20;

## Additional Guidelines for your Project Demo

* You will demo the project in its current state.
* The focus is on the actual artifact you are creating and nothing else.
* Do NOT create a supporting presentation.

### Document your feedback

Always document any feedback you receive on your project management platform after any [critique](critiques.md). This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project (prototype or version), a description of your project progress as it currently stands, and discussion of the feedback you received from the critique. How will this feedback improve your work and ideas?
