![Keep Going Illustration by Jolby from Gettoworkbook](<../.gitbook/assets/gettoworkbook keep going.png>)

Project Demos will be held on designated Mondays. Each demo will consist of:

* Up to 5 minutes max of presentation and&#x20;
* use the remaining time for feedback
* 10 minutes total

Review the rules of the [critiques](critiques.md) (AKA crits).

* Have a member of your accountability team take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not.&#x20;

## Additional Guidelines for your Project Demo

* You will demo the project in its current state.
* The focus is on the actual artifact you are creating and nothing else.
* Do NOT create a supporting presentation.

### Document your feedback

Always document any feedback you receive on your project management platform after any [critique](critiques.md). This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project (prototype or version), a description of your project progress as it currently stands, and discussion of the feedback you received from the critique. How will this feedback improve your work and ideas?
