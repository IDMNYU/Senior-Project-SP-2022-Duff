# Individual "One on One" Meetings

Individual "One on One" Meetings will be held over Zoom or in-person on specific class days and at midterm and finals.&#x20;

You can always schedule a meeting with me beyond your "one-on-one" meetings at [http://calendly.com/deangela](http://calendly.com/deangela). Please schedule them via Zoom unless you want to meet on a Monday. If you want to meet on a Monday, you can schedule it in person via [http://calendly.com/deangela](http://calendly.com/deangela).

Be prepared to present and discuss your work at your appointed time. Students should plan ahead and ensure that technical requirements necessary for the review of work are ready to go _prior_ to meeting with the instructor. Also, have any required documents ready to go, as well.

Individual meetings are **not optional**. They are important and useful. Sometimes they are most useful exactly when you feel you have nothing to talk about or show. It is normal that you may sometimes have nothing "good" to show, or even nothing at all. It is still important that you keep your appointment so that we can talk about that.&#x20;

If for some unusual reason you cannot make your appointment one week, please swap times with a classmate.
